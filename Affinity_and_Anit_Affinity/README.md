## Introduction

Kubernetes is a powerful container orchestration platform, and scheduling is one of its most vital features. Scheduling determines how workloads are distributed across cluster nodes to optimize performance, reliability, and resource utilization.

When deploying workloads, fine-grained control over their placement is often required. Kubernetes provides mechanisms like Node Selector, Node Affinity, Pod Affinity, and Pod Anti-Affinity to define these placement rules.

---

## 1. Node Selector

Node Selector is the simplest scheduling mechanism. It allows you to specify a key-value pair, and Kubernetes schedules pods only on nodes with matching labels.

### YAML Example: Node Selector with Deployment

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: node-selector-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
      nodeSelector:
        color: blue
```

**Explanation:**  
This deployment will schedule pods only on nodes labeled `color=blue`.

---

## 2. Node Affinity

Node Affinity provides advanced scheduling options compared to Node Selector. It allows you to use logical operators like `In`, `NotIn`, `Exists`, and more. You can define both hard and soft constraints.

### Hard Constraint

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: node-affinity-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            nodeSelectorTerms:
            - matchExpressions:
              - key: color
                operator: In
                values:
                - green
```

**Explanation:**  
Pods will only be scheduled on nodes labeled `color=green`.

### Soft Constraint

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: preferred-node-affinity-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
          preferredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          - weight: 1
            preference:
              matchExpressions:
              - key: color
                operator: In
                values:
                - yellow
```

**Explanation:**  
Pods prefer nodes labeled `color=yellow` but can still run on other nodes if such nodes are unavailable.

---

## 3. Pod Affinity

Pod Affinity allows you to schedule pods closer to other pods with specific labels, improving inter-pod communication.

### YAML Example: Pod Affinity with Deployment

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: pod-affinity-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
      affinity:
        podAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          - labelSelector:
              matchLabels:
                color: blue
            topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
```

**Explanation:**  
Pods will be scheduled on the same node or close to other pods labeled `color=blue`.

---

## 4. Node Anti-Affinity

Node Anti-Affinity ensures that pods do not run on certain nodes.

### YAML Example: Node Anti-Affinity with Deployment

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: node-anti-affinity-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
      affinity:
        nodeAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
            nodeSelectorTerms:
            - matchExpressions:
              - key: color
                operator: NotIn
                values:
                - yellow
```

**Explanation:**  
Pods will avoid nodes labeled `color=yellow`.

---

## 5. Pod Anti-Affinity

Pod Anti-Affinity ensures that pods are not scheduled near other pods with specific labels.

### YAML Example: Pod Anti-Affinity with Deployment

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: pod-anti-affinity-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx
      affinity:
        podAntiAffinity:
          requiredDuringSchedulingIgnoredDuringExecution:
          - labelSelector:
              matchLabels:
                color: green
            topologyKey: kubernetes.io/hostname
```

**Explanation:**  
Pods will avoid being scheduled on the same node as other pods labeled `color=green`.

| **Strictness**           | Can be strict (`NoSchedule`, `NoExecute`)   | Soft (`preferred`) or hard (`required`) rules                           |
| **Use Case**             | Reserve nodes for certain workloads (e.g., GPU, Spot) | Keep pods together (affinity) or apart (anti-affinity) based on labels |

|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Taints & Tolerations** | "Bouncer and Guest List" <br>Nodes are like clubs with bouncers (taints), and pods need VIP passes (tolerations) to get in. |
| **Affinity**            | "Birds of a feather flock together" <br>Pods prefer to be scheduled near similar pods or on certain nodes. |
| **Anti-Affinity**       | "Social distancing" <br>Pods want to avoid each other and not run together. |
